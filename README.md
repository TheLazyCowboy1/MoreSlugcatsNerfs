# MoreSlugcats Nerfs (Rain World mod)

This mod remixes the Downpour campaigns by making the slugcats less absurdly powerful whilst reducing difficulty to compensate.

I plan to deprecate this mod in favor of using 90% of its code for a new, more versatile mod that would do the same and more.

The code doesn't have many comments, but its mostly very simple hooks.
